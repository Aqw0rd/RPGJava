A given company (Company A) require a new point of sale and stock control system for their many stores throughout the region to replace their current existing systems. Each store will have a server with multiple pc-based clients attached. The store server will perform functions both for the front-of-house sales area and for the store warehouse at the back. It will also have access to information about the stock in the many regional warehouses.
 
In a store, a sales assistant will be able to process an order for immediate collection or delivery of in-stock items and/or backordered collection or delivery if items are currently unavailable. The sales assistant will also be able to check pricing and stock without creating an order, progress orders that have been backordered or created for delivery, or make a refund provided that a valid receipt is produced. The system will require that the sales assistant identify themselves each time before allowing them to process or progress an order or make a refund.
 
The store manager will be able at any time to print a summary report of sales in the store for a given period, including assignment of sales to sales assistants in order to calculate weekly sales bonuses.
 
The stock manager will be able to monitor stock levels and weekly run-rates in order to set minimum stock levels and requisition products which fall below the minimum stock levels or for which demand is anticipated. The stock manager will decide which products from the catalogue will be held in the store warehouse and which will always have to be ordered. When the stock arrives it will be booked in by the warehouse person. Stock that has been backordered for collection from the store is held in a separate area and the store manager advised of its arrival.
 
The sales assistant will process an order by entering product numbers and required quantities into the system. The system will display a description, price and available stock. In-stock products will normally be collected immediately by the customer from the store but may be selected for delivery to the customer’s home address for which there will be a charge. If stock is not available the sales assistant will be able to create a backorder for the product from a regional warehouse. Backordered products will be delivered from the regional warehouse either direct to the customer’s home address or to the store for collection by the customer. The customer’s name and address will be recorded using the postcode and address completion if any item is for delivery. The system will allow products to be paid for by cash or credit card. If the customer pays cash then the system will calculate the required change. The system will produce a receipt including all order information. For products not on the shelves in the store a picking list or delivery note will be printed in the warehouse including the bin reference, quantity, product number and description.
 
A central system at head office will be used for marketing purposes and to access sales information for each store. The product catalogue will be maintained by marketing who will eventually control stock profiling for all stores and regional warehouses. In addition, a new web server will be installed at head office which will support the Hurry’s website. This server will allow customers browsing the website to select goods and place orders over the internet by credit card for delivery direct to the customer. The server must provide a secure connection for the transfer of order and payment information. Orders arriving by electronic means will be serviced by a virtual store which may exist in a separate location from head office. This virtual store will also service a number of independent store agents who will access the company system via the company intranet which operates through the web server at head office. Agents will have similar order taking facilities to those available to the company’s own stores, except that all goods will be delivered direct to the customer.
